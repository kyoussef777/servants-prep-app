# Permissions

Complete reference for authorization in this application. **Read this before
touching any authorization code.**

Two different models coexist, and using the wrong one is the most likely way to
introduce a security bug here:

| Mode | Model | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| Servants Prep | **Role-based** — pure `role → boolean` allowlists | `lib/roles.ts` |
| Sunday School | **Assignment-based** — authority over a named scope | `lib/sunday-school-access.ts` |

The reason for the split is in [Why Sunday School is not
role-based](#why-sunday-school-is-not-role-based) below. The short version: one
person can serve both sides, and `User.role` holds a single value.

---

## Roles

`UserRole` (in `prisma/schema.prisma`, import from `@prisma/client`) has six
values. A role describes someone's standing in the **prep program**; it says
nothing about Sunday School except for `SUPER_ADMIN` and `PRIEST`.

| Role | Prep program | Sunday School | Manages users |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Full | Full, every class | All users |
| `PRIEST` | Full, read-only | Reads every class, writes nothing | None |
| `SERVANT_PREP` | Full | **Only if personally assigned** | `STUDENT`, `MENTOR` |
| `MENTOR` | Own mentees, read-only | None | None |
| `STUDENT` | Own data, read-only | None | None |
| `SERVANT` | **None** | Only their assignments | None |

Two rules that hold in both directions:

- **`SERVANT` has no prep-side permission.** Every prep helper is an explicit
  allowlist, so this holds by construction rather than by remembering to
  exclude it. `__tests__/lib/roles.test.ts` pins it — keep that test passing
  when you add a helper.
- **`SERVANT_PREP` has no Sunday School permission.** Running the prep program
  confers nothing in the other mode.

`PRIEST` is read-only **everywhere**. When adding a write path, confirm it is
excluded.

---

## Servants Prep: role helpers

All in `lib/roles.ts`. Each is a pure function of the role, safe to call on the
client, and used identically on both sides.

### Identity

| Helper | True for |
|---|---|
| `isSuperAdmin` | `SUPER_ADMIN` |
| `isPriest` | `PRIEST` |
| `isServantPrep` | `SERVANT_PREP` |
| `isMentor` | `MENTOR` |
| `isStudent` | `STUDENT` |
| `isServant` | `SERVANT` |
| `isAdmin` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `PRIEST`, `SERVANT_PREP` |

### Capability

| Helper | True for | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `canAccessAdmin` | admin roles | Viewing the admin dashboard |
| `canManageData` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Attendance, exams, curriculum writes |
| `canManageCurriculum` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Lessons |
| `canManageExams` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Exams and scores |
| `canManageEnrollments` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Enrollment records |
| `canAssignMentors` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Mentor assignment |
| `canSelfAssignMentees` | `MENTOR` | A mentor claiming mentees |
| `canBeMentor` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP`, `MENTOR` | Eligibility to hold mentees |
| `canViewStudents` | admin roles + `MENTOR` | Student lists (mentors filtered to their own) |
| `isReadOnlyAdmin` | `PRIEST` | Rendering read-only affordances |
| `canReviewAsyncNotes` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Approving async note submissions |
| `canSetAsyncStatus` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Marking a student async |
| `canSubmitAsyncContent` | `STUDENT` | Submitting notes (must also *be* async) |
| `canManageInviteCodes` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Registration invite codes |
| `canReviewRegistrations` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | Approving registrations |
| `canViewRegistrations` | admin roles | Reading registration submissions |
| `canManageSundaySchool` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` | **Prep-side only** — the async serving-verification flow (codes, logs). Not Sunday School mode. |

### User management

| Helper | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `canManageUsers` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SERVANT_PREP` may manage *some* users |
| `canManageAllUsers` | `SUPER_ADMIN` alone may manage *any* user |
| `SERVANT_PREP_MANAGEABLE_ROLES` | `[STUDENT, MENTOR]` |
| `canServantPrepManageRole(target)` | Whether a `SERVANT_PREP` may act on that role |

`SERVANT` is deliberately **not** in `SERVANT_PREP_MANAGEABLE_ROLES`. Servant
accounts are created by `SUPER_ADMIN` only. Enforced in `app/api/users/route.ts`,
`app/api/users/[id]/route.ts`, and `app/api/profile-picture/upload/route.ts`.

A `SERVANT_PREP` also cannot use a role filter on `GET /api/users` to look
outside their permitted set — the filter can only narrow it.

---

## Sunday School: assignment-based authority

### The model

A `SundaySchoolServantAssignment` row says: **this person**, for **this
academic year**, has **this authority** over **this scope**.

- **Authority** — `SundaySchoolAuthority`: `SERVANT` or `COORDINATOR`
- **Scope** — exactly one of `classId` or `ageGroupId`. Never both, never
  neither. Prisma cannot express that, so the API validates it.

An **age group** (`SundaySchoolAgeGroup`) is a band like Elementary, Middle
School, or High School, owning a set of grade levels. A class's band is
**derived from its `level`** — whichever age group lists it. There is no
`ageGroupId` on the class, so moving a grade between bands re-parents its
classes with no migration.

### Who can do what

| Who | Scope | Powers |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Everything | All of the below, everywhere, plus age groups and servant accounts |
| `PRIEST` | Everything | Read only |
| Age-group coordinator | Every class in their band | Everything a class coordinator can, **plus create and delete classes** in that band. Sees only their own band. |
| Class coordinator | One class | Edit the class, staff it, manage its children, and record child and servant attendance. **No** create/delete. |
| Servant of a class | One class | That class's children and weekly child attendance; no servant-attendance entry or reporting |
| Anyone else, including an unassigned `SERVANT_PREP` | — | Nothing |

Only `SERVANT` and `SERVANT_PREP` accounts may be assigned
(`SUNDAY_SCHOOL_ASSIGNABLE_ROLES`).

### The role helpers that remain

Only these four things about Sunday School are genuinely role-derived:

| Helper | True for | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `canAdministerSundaySchool` | `SUPER_ADMIN` | Age groups, servant accounts, any class |
| `seesAllSundaySchoolClasses` | `SUPER_ADMIN`, `PRIEST` | Visibility without an assignment |
| `isSundaySchoolReadOnly` | `PRIEST` | Sees, never writes |
| `canBeAssignedToSundaySchool` | `SERVANT`, `SERVANT_PREP` | May receive an assignment |

Everything else goes through the resolver.

### Using the resolver

```typescript
import {
  getSundaySchoolAccess,
  canServeClass,
  canCoordinateClass,
  canTakeServantAttendance,
  canCreateClassAtLevel,
  canDeleteClass,
  canCoordinateAgeGroup,
  canViewClass,
  visibleClassFilter,
} from "@/lib/sunday-school-access"

// One DB round trip; defaults to the active academic year
const access = await getSundaySchoolAccess(user)

if (!canServeClass(access, classId)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Forbidden" }, { status: 403 })
}
```

`getSundaySchoolAccess` returns a `SundaySchoolAccess`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `isAdmin` | `SUPER_ADMIN` — passes every check |
| `readOnly` | `PRIEST` — fails every write check |
| `canRead` | Has any way into the mode at all |
| `servantClassIds` | Classes they serve |
| `coordinatorClassIds` | Classes they coordinate — direct assignments **plus** every class expanded from their bands |
| `coordinatorAgeGroupIds` | Bands they coordinate |
| `coordinatorLevels` | Grade levels those bands own — what gates class creation |
| `visibleClassIds` | `'all'` for admin/priest, otherwise the visible set |

The predicates over it are pure, so they unit-test without a database — see
`__tests__/lib/sunday-school-access.test.ts`.

Use `visibleClassFilter(access)` to scope a Prisma query. It returns `undefined`
when no filter is needed, matching the contract of `getMentorStudentIds`.

### Non-negotiable rules

1. **Always re-derive authority from the database inside the route.** The
   `session.user.sundaySchool` standing (`{ hasAccess, isCoordinator }`, set in
   `lib/auth.ts`) exists only to decide whether to render a nav entry. It is
   coarse and up to a minute stale. Never authorize from it.
2. **Never grant Sunday School power from a prep role.** If you are about to
   write `role === 'SERVANT_PREP'` in a Sunday School route, that is the bug
   this model was built to prevent.
3. **Check the destination, not just the source.** Moving a child or a class
   needs authority over where it is going, or someone could push a record into
   a class they have nothing to do with.
4. **Guardian contact is sensitive.** Children are minors. It is returned only
   by `/api/sunday-school/children*`, only to people who serve that child's
   class and to admins — never from the dashboard summary or the command
   palette.
5. **A grade level belongs to at most one age group.** Enforced by
   `assertLevelsUnclaimed` on every age-group write. Without it a class would
   sit in two bands and answer to two coordinators.

### Feedback exception for priests

The Sunday School feedback board is a product forum, not a write to ministry
records. Anyone with `access.canRead` may submit ideas and vote, including
`PRIEST`. This is the sole deliberate exception to the normal priest read-only
rule. Priests may edit or delete only their own open ideas and never receive
moderation authority; changing idea statuses or deleting another person's idea
remains `SUPER_ADMIN`-only. All feedback routes still call
`getSundaySchoolAccess` and refuse users who cannot enter Sunday School.

## Why Sunday School is not role-based

The first implementation gave the `SERVANT_PREP` role blanket Sunday School
power. That was wrong: a prep leader with no Sunday School involvement could
create servant accounts, staff classes, and edit any child's record.

Adding roles like `HIGH_SCHOOL_COORDINATOR` would not have fixed it:

- It bakes one org chart into a Postgres enum. Splitting Elementary later, or
  handing one person both Middle and High, becomes a migration.
- `User.role` holds a single value, so a `SERVANT_PREP` who *also* coordinates
  High School still could not be described.

What the ministry actually has is one idea at three sizes — authority over a
class, over a band, or over everything. That is a **scope**, and scopes belong
in data. Every case is now a row: a High School Coordinator is a `COORDINATOR`
assignment scoped to the High School age group. Adding a Pre-K coordinator, or
moving Grade 6 from Elementary to Middle, is data entry.

## Session and client-side guards

The JWT carries a coarse standing so synchronous renders (the navbar switcher,
page guards) do not need a fetch:

```typescript
session.user.sundaySchool // { hasAccess: boolean, isCoordinator: boolean }
```

It is recomputed on sign-in and on the periodic (~60s) token revalidation in
`lib/auth.ts`. Assignment changes therefore take effect within about a minute
for navigation purposes — and immediately for anything the server enforces.

Page guards:

| Hook | Use for |
|---|---|
| `useAdminGuard(roleCheck)` | Prep pages — takes a role predicate |
| `useSundaySchoolGuard()` | Sunday School pages — reads session standing |

Both redirect to `/login` when signed out and `/dashboard` when unauthorized.
Neither is a security boundary; the API is.

Per-class affordances come from the **API payload**, not from the client
re-deriving anything: list and detail responses carry `canServe`,
`canCoordinate`, `canTakeServantAttendance`, and `canDelete` for each class.

---

## Testing authorization

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `__tests__/lib/roles.test.ts` | Every prep helper; `SERVANT` denied across all of them; `SERVANT_PREP` cannot manage a `SERVANT` |
| `__tests__/lib/sunday-school-access.test.ts` | The predicates: band coordinator reaches their band and nothing outside it; class coordinator cannot create or delete; unassigned `SERVANT_PREP` gets nothing; `PRIEST` reads but never writes; level-ownership rules |
| `__tests__/api/api-authorization.test.ts` | Route-level expectations across both models |
| `__tests__/api/sunday-school-servant-attendance.test.ts` | Servant-attendance authorization, validation, roster scope, and idempotent saves |

When you add a permission, add its denial cases too — a test that only proves
the happy path does not protect anything.
