# Asynchronous Student Feature - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for the **Asynchronous Student** feature, which encompasses two major components:

1. **Lesson Notes Submission** - Async students submit notes for lessons to count as attendance
2. **Sunday School Placement** - Async students are placed in one Sunday School grade per year and must maintain 75% weekly attendance over a 6-week period each year

The key challenge addressed is verifying Sunday School attendance when the Sunday School servants are NOT app users.

## Document Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2026-01-30 | Initial plan |
| 2.0 | 2026-01-30 | Added Sunday School rotation, verification system, clarified RBAC |
| 3.0 | 2026-02-07 | Major redesign: SS placement model (1 grade/year, 6 weeks, 75% attendance), note approval reversal, SERVANT_PREP async permissions, SS excusal support |

---

## 1. Feature Summary

### 1.1 Description

The Asynchronous Student feature provides an alternative pathway for students who cannot attend Servants Prep lessons in person. These students:

1. **Submit lesson notes** that administrators review and approve to count as attendance
2. **Are placed in one Sunday School grade per year** and attend weekly for ~6 weeks, verified via codes
3. **Must maintain 75% Sunday School attendance** each year as an additional graduation requirement

### 1.2 Confirmed Requirements

| Requirement | Decision |
|-------------|----------|
| Who approves notes? | SUPER_ADMIN and SERVANT_PREP |
| Can approved notes be reverted? | **Yes** — reversal deletes the linked AttendanceRecord |
| Deadline for note submissions? | **None** — students can submit anytime |
| Minimum note length? | **None** — admins judge quality during review |
| Mentor access to notes? | **View only** — cannot approve/reject |
| Who can set async status? | **SUPER_ADMIN and SERVANT_PREP** |
| Sunday School model | **1 grade per year**, attend weekly for **6 weeks**, need **75% attendance** each year |
| Sunday School grades | Pre-K, K, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th+ (**8 grades**) |
| Sunday School excusals | SUPER_ADMIN and SERVANT_PREP can excuse, just like regular attendance |
| Sunday School code reuse | Allowed after rejection — student can resubmit with same code |

### 1.3 User Stories

#### Lesson Notes
| Role | User Story |
|------|------------|
| **STUDENT (Async)** | As an async student, I want to submit notes for lessons so they count as attendance. |
| **STUDENT (Async)** | As an async student, I want to see my submission history and status (pending/approved/rejected). |
| **STUDENT (Async)** | As an async student, I want to resubmit notes if they were rejected, with guidance from the feedback. |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to review and approve/reject note submissions with optional feedback. |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to revert an approved note if I made a mistake. |
| **MENTOR** | As a mentor, I want to view my mentees' note submissions (read-only) to track their engagement. |

#### Sunday School
| Role | User Story |
|------|------------|
| **STUDENT (Async)** | As an async student, I want to log my weekly Sunday School attendance using a verification code. |
| **STUDENT (Async)** | As an async student, I want to see my week-by-week attendance for my assigned grade. |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to assign async students to a Sunday School grade for the year. |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to generate and manage weekly verification codes for Sunday School classes. |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to excuse a student's Sunday School absence (excluded from attendance %). |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to manually approve a week's attendance without a code (exceptions). |
| **SUPER_ADMIN/SERVANT_PREP** | As an admin, I want to reject a fraudulent attendance entry. |

### 1.4 Success Criteria

1. Async students can submit and track lesson notes with full approval workflow (including reversal)
2. Approved notes create standard PRESENT attendance records; reversal deletes them
3. Sunday School placement tracks weekly attendance within an assigned grade per year
4. Sunday School attendance uses 75% threshold with excusal support (same formula as regular attendance)
5. Verification codes provide reasonable fraud protection without burdening non-app-user servants
6. Graduation requirements include Sunday School 75% attendance for async students
7. All existing graduation calculation logic remains unchanged for regular attendance
8. Full RBAC compliance across all operations

---

## 2. Sunday School Placement System

### 2.1 Overview

Each year, async students are **placed in one Sunday School grade** and attend that grade's class weekly for a **6-week period**. They must maintain **75% attendance** (same formula as regular Servants Prep attendance) each year to meet graduation requirements.

### 2.2 Grade Levels (8 Available)

| Grade Key | Display Name | Typical Age |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `PRE_K` | Pre-K | 3-4 years |
| `KINDERGARTEN` | Kindergarten | 5-6 years |
| `GRADE_1` | 1st Grade | 6-7 years |
| `GRADE_2` | 2nd Grade | 7-8 years |
| `GRADE_3` | 3rd Grade | 8-9 years |
| `GRADE_4` | 4th Grade | 9-10 years |
| `GRADE_5` | 5th Grade | 10-11 years |
| `GRADE_6_PLUS` | 6th Grade+ | 11+ years |

**Requirement:** Each academic year, the student is assigned to **one grade** and attends for **6 weeks**. They need **75% attendance** (using the same formula as regular attendance) to pass.

### 2.3 Attendance Calculation

Mirrors the regular Servants Prep attendance formula:

```
percentage = present_count / (total_weeks - excused_count)
```

Where:
- `present_count` = weeks with status VERIFIED or MANUAL
- `excused_count` = weeks with status EXCUSED (excluded from calculation)
- `total_weeks` = 6 (configurable per assignment)

**75% threshold required** for each year's assignment.

### 2.4 Verification Challenge

**Problem:** Sunday School servants are NOT app users. We need to verify that async students actually attended these classes.

**Solution:** A **Weekly Verification Code System** that balances security with simplicity.

### 2.5 Verification Code System Design

#### How It Works

1. **Admin generates weekly codes** — Each Sunday, a unique code is generated per grade level
2. **Codes are distributed** — Admin shares codes with Sunday School coordinators (via group chat, printed sheet, etc.)
3. **Servant provides code** — After class, the Sunday School servant gives the code to the async student
4. **Student logs attendance** — Student enters the code in the app within 7 days
5. **System validates** — Code must match the student's assigned grade and be within the valid date range

#### Code Format

```
Format: [GRADE_PREFIX]-[RANDOM_CHARS]
Example: PK-A7X3  (Pre-K, week of Jan 26)
         G2-B9M2  (2nd Grade, week of Jan 26)

- 2-3 character grade prefix for easy identification
- 4 alphanumeric random characters (~1.68 million combinations per grade)
- Valid for 7 days from generation date
- One code per grade per week
```

#### Security Considerations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Student guesses code | 4 alphanumeric chars = ~1.68M combinations per grade |
| Student shares code | Codes are single-use per student per week |
| Delayed entry | 7-day validity window is reasonable |
| No servant cooperation | Servant just reads code — no app interaction needed |
| Suspected fraud | Admin can reject entry; student can resubmit if legitimate |

## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 New Enums

```prisma
enum NoteSubmissionStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
}

enum SundaySchoolGrade {
  PRE_K
  KINDERGARTEN
  GRADE_1
  GRADE_2
  GRADE_3
  GRADE_4
  GRADE_5
  GRADE_6_PLUS
}

enum SundaySchoolLogStatus {
  VERIFIED     // Code validated — counts as present
  MANUAL       // Admin manually approved — counts as present
  EXCUSED      // Admin excused — excluded from calculation
  REJECTED     // Admin rejected (fraud suspected) — counts as absent
}
```

### 3.2 Modified Model: StudentEnrollment

```prisma
model StudentEnrollment {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Async student fields
  isAsyncStudent          Boolean   @default(false)
  asyncApprovedAt         DateTime?
  asyncApprovedBy         String?
  asyncReason             String?   @db.Text

  // Relations
  asyncApprover           User?     @relation("AsyncApprovedBy", fields: [asyncApprovedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  // ... existing relations ...
}
```

### 3.3 New Model: AsyncNoteSubmission

> **Note:** This is distinct from the existing `StudentNote` model, which stores admin/mentor observations *about* students. `AsyncNoteSubmission` stores lesson notes submitted *by* students as attendance proof.

```prisma
model AsyncNoteSubmission {
  id                 String               @id @default(cuid())
  studentId          String
  lessonId           String
  content            String               @db.Text
  status             NoteSubmissionStatus @default(PENDING)

  // Submission tracking
  submittedAt        DateTime             @default(now())

  // Review tracking
  reviewedBy         String?
  reviewedAt         DateTime?
  reviewFeedback     String?              @db.Text

  // Attendance linkage (created on APPROVED, deleted on reversal)
  attendanceRecordId String?              @unique

  createdAt          DateTime             @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime             @updatedAt

  // Relations
  student            User                 @relation("StudentNoteSubmissions", fields: [studentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  lesson             Lesson               @relation(fields: [lessonId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  reviewer           User?                @relation("ReviewedNoteSubmissions", fields: [reviewedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  attendanceRecord   AttendanceRecord?    @relation(fields: [attendanceRecordId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  // One submission per student per lesson. Resubmission = UPDATE (not new INSERT).
  @@unique([studentId, lessonId])
  @@index([studentId])
  @@index([lessonId])
  @@index([status])
  @@index([submittedAt])
}
```

**Resubmission flow:** The `@@unique([studentId, lessonId])` constraint means a student has one record per lesson. When rejected, the student UPDATEs the existing record (new content, status reset to PENDING, review fields cleared).

**Reversal flow:** When an admin reverts an APPROVED submission, the linked `AttendanceRecord` is deleted, `attendanceRecordId` is set to null, and `status` is reset to PENDING.

### 3.4 New Model: SundaySchoolAssignment

Tracks which grade a student is placed in for each academic year.

```prisma
model SundaySchoolAssignment {
  id              String            @id @default(cuid())
  studentId       String
  grade           SundaySchoolGrade
  academicYearId  String
  yearLevel       YearLevel         // YEAR_1 or YEAR_2 at time of assignment
  totalWeeks      Int               @default(6)
  startDate       DateTime          // When the 6-week period begins
  isActive        Boolean           @default(true)

  assignedBy      String?
  createdAt       DateTime          @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime          @updatedAt

  // Relations
  student         User              @relation("SundaySchoolAssignments", fields: [studentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  academicYear    AcademicYear      @relation(fields: [academicYearId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  assigner        User?             @relation("AssignedSundaySchool", fields: [assignedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  logs            SundaySchoolLog[]

  @@unique([studentId, academicYearId])  // One assignment per student per year
  @@index([studentId])
  @@index([academicYearId])
  @@index([grade])
  @@index([isActive])
}
```

### 3.5 New Model: SundaySchoolCode

Weekly verification codes for Sunday School attendance.

```prisma
model SundaySchoolCode {
  id           String            @id @default(cuid())
  code         String            @unique        // e.g., "PK-A7X3"
  grade        SundaySchoolGrade
  weekOf       DateTime                         // Start of the week (Sunday)
  validUntil   DateTime                         // End of validity (7 days later)

  // Generation tracking
  generatedBy  String?
  generatedAt  DateTime          @default(now())

  // Usage tracking
  isActive     Boolean           @default(true)  // Can be deactivated if compromised

  createdAt    DateTime          @default(now())

  // Relations
  generator    User?             @relation("GeneratedCodes", fields: [generatedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  usages       SundaySchoolLog[]

  @@unique([grade, weekOf])  // One code per grade per week
  @@index([code])
  @@index([grade])
  @@index([weekOf])
  @@index([validUntil])
}
```

### 3.6 New Model: SundaySchoolLog

Tracks individual weekly attendance within a Sunday School assignment.

```prisma
model SundaySchoolLog {
  id            String                @id @default(cuid())
  assignmentId  String
  weekNumber    Int                   // 1 through totalWeeks
  weekOf        DateTime              // The Sunday date

  // Status
  status        SundaySchoolLogStatus // VERIFIED, MANUAL, EXCUSED, REJECTED

  // Verification
  codeId        String?               // Link to verification code (if VERIFIED)

  // Admin action tracking (for MANUAL, EXCUSED, or REJECTED)
  markedBy      String?
  notes         String?               @db.Text

  // Student notes about the experience (optional)
  studentNotes  String?               @db.Text

  createdAt     DateTime              @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime              @updatedAt

  // Relations
  assignment    SundaySchoolAssignment @relation(fields: [assignmentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  code          SundaySchoolCode?      @relation(fields: [codeId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  marker        User?                  @relation("MarkedSundaySchoolLogs", fields: [markedBy], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)

  @@unique([assignmentId, weekNumber])  // One log per week per assignment
  @@index([assignmentId])
  @@index([status])
  @@index([weekOf])
}
```

### 3.7 Modified Model: User

Add new relations:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields and relations ...

  // Async notes relations
  noteSubmissions           AsyncNoteSubmission[]      @relation("StudentNoteSubmissions")
  reviewedNoteSubmissions   AsyncNoteSubmission[]      @relation("ReviewedNoteSubmissions")

## 7. Integration with Existing Features

### 7.1 Graduation Requirements

**Current Requirements (unchanged):**
1. Attendance >= 75%
2. Overall exam average >= 75%
3. Each exam section >= 60%
4. Complete both YEAR_1 and YEAR_2

**Additional Requirement for Async Students:**
5. Sunday School attendance >= 75% for each year's assignment

**Implementation:**
- Analytics endpoint includes `sundaySchool.allMet` flag
- Graduation dialog checks this flag for async students
- If not met, shown as an issue: "Sunday School: X% attendance (need 75%)"
- The `StudentAnalytics` interface in `graduation-dialog.tsx` gains an optional `sundaySchoolMet` field
- `graduationEligible` on the backend: existing checks AND (if async) `sundaySchool.allMet`

### 7.2 Attendance Calculation (NO CHANGES to existing)

The existing `lib/attendance-utils.ts` requires **no modifications**:
- Approved async notes create standard `AttendanceRecord` entries with status PRESENT
- Reverting an approved note deletes the `AttendanceRecord`
- Calculation continues to use same formula
- Sunday School attendance is tracked separately (not part of regular attendance %)

### 7.3 Sunday School Attendance Calculation (NEW)

Uses the same conceptual formula as regular attendance:

```typescript
// lib/sunday-school-utils.ts
function calculateSSAttendance(logs: SundaySchoolLog[], totalWeeks: number) {
  const present = logs.filter(l => l.status === 'VERIFIED' || l.status === 'MANUAL').length
  const excused = logs.filter(l => l.status === 'EXCUSED').length
  const effectiveTotal = totalWeeks - excused

  if (effectiveTotal === 0) return null  // All weeks excused
  return (present / effectiveTotal) * 100
}
```

### 7.4 Analytics Integration

Both analytics endpoints will:
1. Calculate attendance from AttendanceRecord (unchanged)
2. Include async note stats as supplementary data
3. Include Sunday School progress for async students (per-year attendance %)
4. Factor Sunday School into graduation eligibility for async students only
5. Not double-count anything

5. Test SS excusal in attendance calculation
6. Test graduation flow for async students
7. Test resubmission after rejection (both notes and SS logs)

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|:----------:|:------:|------------|
| Attendance double-counting | Low | High | Unique constraints in database |
| Permission bypass | Medium | High | Comprehensive RBAC at API level |
| Note reversal orphans | Low | Medium | Transaction wraps reversal + AR deletion |
| Graduation calc breakage | Low | Critical | All existing logic unchanged; SS is additive |
| SS attendance miscalculation | Low | Medium | Shared utility with unit tests |

### 9.2 Sunday School Fraud Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|:----------:|:------:|------------|
| Student guesses code | Very Low | Low | 4 alphanum = ~1.68M combinations per grade |
| Student shares code | Low | Low | Each student submits for their assigned grade only |
| Code photo sharing | Low | Low | Social trust, admin spot-checks |
| Wrong grade submission | None | None | System validates code grade matches assignment |

### 9.3 Mitigation Strategies

**Async Notes:**
1. Review workflow with approve/reject/revert
2. Bulk review for efficiency
3. Rejection feedback for student improvement

**Sunday School:**
1. Code validation (automatic)
2. Grade-locked assignments (student can only submit for their assigned grade)
3. Admin excusal/manual approve for legitimate exceptions
4. Admin rejection for suspected fraud
5. Social accountability
