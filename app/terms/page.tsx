              The portal is for people participating in or administering authorized St. Mark ministries. Children
              under 13 may not independently create an account or submit personal information. Their parent,
              guardian, or an authorized ministry leader must act for them. Older minors may use an account only
              with appropriate guardian permission and church authorization. The church may require confirmation
              of identity, age, authority, or guardianship.

                The portal supports Sunday School and the Servants Preparation Program. Features may include
                registration, class and servant assignments, attendance, lessons, exams, mentoring, notes, files,
                notifications, annual rollover, and ministry reporting.

              <p>
                The portal is an administrative tool. It is not an emergency service, medical record system,
                professional counseling service, or replacement for direct communication with clergy, ministry
                leaders, guardians, or emergency services.

              access. You may not share an account, allow another person to use your session, or attempt to take
              over another person&apos;s account. You are responsible for activity performed through your account until
              you notify us of a security issue.

              relationships limit whose records a person may access. Access to a screen or record does not give
              permission to copy, download, photograph, disclose, or use the information outside the assigned
              church responsibility. You must stop using information when the relevant role, assignment, or
              relationship ends, even if technical access has not yet been removed.

              another person; use automated tools that burden the portal; upload unlawful, harmful, or infringing
              material; enter information you know is false; harass another user; or use ministry information for
              personal, political, commercial, advertising, or other non-ministry purposes.

                Ministry records, especially records about children, guardians, mentoring, conduct, grades,
                attendance, and religious participation, are confidential. Users must follow church safeguarding
                practices and report suspected abuse, safety concerns, or unauthorized disclosure through the
                church&apos;s established channels. Do not rely on a portal note as the only way to report an urgent
                concern.

              are authorized to hold, protect a child&apos;s information, and tell church administration when custody,
              guardianship, or access authority changes. A guardian link is a portal access relationship and does

              push-notification, and curriculum services. Your use of a third-party service may also be governed by
              that provider&apos;s terms. The church does not control an external site merely because the portal links
              to it and is not responsible for third-party content or independent practices.

              those practices. Where consent is legally required, we will request it separately rather than relying

              the portal available, but service may be interrupted by maintenance, provider outages, security
              events, or circumstances outside the church&apos;s control. Users should preserve any separate records

              is no longer appropriate for ministry operations. You may request account closure. Closing an account

              for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, and uninterrupted or error-free operation.

              damages arising from portal interruption, data loss, unauthorized misuse, third-party services, or
