                The St. Mark Church Ministry Portal is operated for the Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint Mark
                in Jersey City, New Jersey. It supports the church&apos;s Sunday School and Servants Preparation
                ministries. This policy applies to the portal, its registration forms, and the ministry records
                maintained through it. It does not govern unrelated church websites or third-party sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this policy, &quot;the church,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; and &quot;us&quot; refer to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Saint
                Mark and the authorized ministry leaders who operate the portal on its behalf.

                Google sign-in identifier, and sign-in or session information.

                Servants Preparation records may include enrollment and year level, mentor and father-of-

                lesson progress, eligibility or graduation status, notes, signed approval forms, profile photos,
                and attendance or confession-verification slips. The portal is not intended to record the
                content of a confession.

                Sunday School records may include a child&apos;s name, date of birth, grade or level, class and

                servant assignments and attendance, lesson plans, registrations, feedback, and related notes.
                Roster imports may also record source filename, row outcomes, and import history.

              Information may be provided by you, a parent or guardian, the child where appropriate, authorized
              church staff or servants, a mentor, or an administrator importing an existing ministry roster.
              We also receive limited account information from Google if you choose Google sign-in, and
              technical information automatically from your browser, device, and our service providers.

              <p>
                The portal is not intended for unsupervised self-registration by children under 13. A parent,
                legal guardian, or authorized ministry leader should provide information for a younger child.
                A child does not need an email address or portal account to appear on a Sunday School roster.
              </p>
              <p>
                A guardian account receives access to a child&apos;s information only after an active guardian
                relationship is approved or created in the portal. Parents and guardians may ask to review or
                correct their child&apos;s information, end a guardian link, or request deletion, subject to identity
                verification and records the church must reasonably retain for safeguarding, ministry history,
                or legal obligations.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you believe a child submitted personal information without appropriate guardian authorization,
                contact us so we can review the account and take appropriate action.

              We use information to authenticate users; review applications; manage accounts, roles, classes,
              rosters, and guardian links; record attendance, service, lessons, exams, mentoring, and progress;
              coordinate annual rollover; communicate ministry updates; send requested notifications; support
              users; investigate misuse; maintain audit history; protect the portal and church community; and
              improve the portal&apos;s reliability and ministry administration.

              The portal may calculate attendance percentages, exam averages, missing requirements, or an
              eligibility status from ministry records. These calculations are administrative aids, not final
              decisions made solely by an automated system. Authorized ministry leaders may review the underlying
              records, correct errors, and make exceptions or final ministry decisions.

              Access is limited by role tags, current ministry assignments, mentor relationships, and guardian
              relationships. Super administrators operate the portal; clergy may receive broad read-only access;
              coordinators and servants receive the scope needed for assigned classes or programs; mentors receive
              access to assigned mentees; students receive access to their own records; and guardians receive
              access to linked children. Authorized people must use information only for their church duties.

                We use service providers to operate the portal, including Vercel for application hosting, file
                storage, performance measurement, and privacy-focused web analytics; Neon for managed database
                hosting; Google for optional sign-in and linked ministry resources; and browser or device push
                services when you enable notifications. These providers may process information only as needed
                to provide their services and under their own terms and privacy notices.

              <p>
                We may also disclose information when required by law; to respond to a valid legal request; to
                investigate abuse or a security incident; to protect a child or another person from harm; or in
                connection with a transition to a successor church-operated service. We do not sell personal
                information, share it for cross-context behavioral advertising, or use ministry records for
                targeted advertising.

                The portal uses essential cookies and browser storage for secure sign-in, session continuity,
                security protections, theme preferences, and selected portal settings. Blocking essential cookies

                location, browser, operating system, device type, and performance measurements. Vercel describes
                its standard web analytics as aggregated and not tied to a person or persistent cross-site
                identifier. We do not intentionally send names, contact details, ministry notes, or record contents

              Push notifications are optional. If enabled, we store a device subscription endpoint, encryption

              <p>
                We retain information for as long as it is reasonably needed to run the ministries, preserve
                academic-year and service history, support safeguarding and accountability, resolve disputes,
                maintain security, and meet legal obligations. Role grants, assignments, attendance, audit records,
                and ministry outcomes may be archived rather than overwritten so the church can understand the
                historical record.
              </p>
              <p>
                Retention depends on the record&apos;s purpose, sensitivity, age, and whether an account or ministry
                relationship remains active. When information is no longer reasonably needed, we may delete,
                anonymize, or securely archive it. Provider backups and logs may remain for a limited period after
                deletion. A request to delete an account does not necessarily remove records that must remain part
                of another person&apos;s ministry history, an audit trail, or a safeguarding record.

                We use role-based access controls, assignment-based scoping, password hashing, authenticated
                sessions, transport encryption, administrative audit records, and service-provider safeguards.
                Access should be removed when a person&apos;s ministry responsibility ends. No online system can
                guarantee absolute security.

              record deletion. We may need to verify your identity, authority, or guardianship before responding.

              records, maintain safeguarding or audit history, or comply with law, and will explain the reason when

              financial information, the substance of a confession, or other highly sensitive information into a
